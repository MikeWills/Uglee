Welcome to Uglee 2.0. The funbot/moderator bot you can have fun with. While this bot has much to come, it is stable enough for you to start using.

Installation:
`npm install`

Start the bot:
`./startUglee.sh`

Most of the configuration settings are stored in the database, so a database is required.

Core Functions:
* The bot can AutoDJ
* The bot can AutoBop if 40% of the room or more is bopping (or lames if 40% or more of the room lames).
* You can ban users
* The bot can have per-room settings. So you can move it between rooms easily.
* The bot can keep track of the play count and boot after so many songs. (Beta, known issues)
* The bot can use a DJ queue. (This feature isn't well tested and is in alpha stage)
