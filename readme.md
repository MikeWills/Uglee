This is the new readme.md for the new version of this bot. I won't publish a new config for the bot until I have this working back to where the old bot was.

Installation:
`npm install`

Start the bot:
`./startUglee.sh`

Most of the configuration is stored in the database, so a database is required.

Core Functions:
* AutoDJs
* AutoBop at 40% of the room is bopping (lames if 40% of the room lames).
* Ban users
* Per-room settings
* Play count moderation (beta)
